soundquake

[soundquake.d-bow.com]

a webGL audio/visual piece created at ArtHackWeekendSF to represent data sets
in both a literal and abstract way.  the current data set is bay area earthquakes
since 1973.  the piece cycles through the data, representing each earthquake as a
geolocated elevation on the map that spreads outward. it also uses the web audio api
to play a banjo note based on the magnitude of the quake. the end result is a
meditative experience, abstracted from the source data set.

Currently being adapted for installation at the creator's project in SF:
